    <h4><em>A delicious burger with full garnishing.</em></h4>
    <p>
        The burger, now a quintessential part of global cuisine, has humble beginnings in the late 19th century. Its roots trace back to the Hamburg steak, a minced beef patty popular among German immigrants. However, it wasn't until the early 20th century in the United States that the burger began to take its modern form, with the addition of a bun for easy consumption. The rise of fast-food chains like White Castle and McDonald's in the mid-20th century catapulted the burger into international fame, making it a symbol of American culture and innovation. The taste of a well-crafted burger is a harmonious blend of savory flavors: the juicy, seasoned beef patty offers a robust umami punch, complemented by the freshness of lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, the tanginess of pickles and sauces, and the slight sweetness of a toasted bun. Each bite is a delightful combination of textures and tastes, providing a satisfying and hearty eating experience that has won the hearts of people worldwide.
