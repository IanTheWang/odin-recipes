    <h4><em>A succulent hotdog with some mustard.</em></h4>
    <p>The hotdog, a staple of American street food, has a rich history that dates back to the 19th century. Originating from German immigrants who brought their beloved sausages to the United States, the hotdog evolved into a uniquely American culinary icon. The first hotdog stands appeared in New York City, where vendors sold sausages in rolls, providing a convenient and affordable meal for the working class. The taste of a hotdog is a delightful blend of savory flavors, often enhanced by grilling or boiling. The juicy, spiced sausage is typically encased in a soft, warm bun and can be topped with a variety of condiments such as mustard, ketchup, onions, relish, and sauerkraut, creating a harmony of textures and flavors that is both comforting and satisfying. Each bite offers a taste of tradition and nostalgia, making the hotdog a beloved treat at ballparks, picnics, and street corners across the country.</p>
